```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(mgcv)

birthweight_data = read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
```

## Problem 1

First, clean the birthweight dataset.
```{r}
birthweight_data = 
  birthweight_data %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    babysex = fct_recode(babysex, "male" = "1", "female" = "2"),
    
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    frace = fct_recode(frace, "White" = "1", "Black" = "2", "Asian" = "3", "Puerto Rican" = "4", "Other" = "8"),
    
    malform = as.logical(malform),
    
    mrace = as.factor(mrace),
    mrace = fct_recode(mrace, "White" = "1", "Black" = "2", "Asian" = "3", "Puerto Rican" = "4")
  )

birthweight_data %>% 
  skimr::skim()
```

So there is no missing value in the dataset.
